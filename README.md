Syncit, which refers to 'sync it', is a privacy-first co-browsing tool. It provides pixel-perfect, low-latency, low-bandwidth screen sharing, and remote control.

**Currently, Syncit is at an early development stage. During this stage, API could be changed frequently.**

For better improvement, feature requests and bug reports are welcomed.

## Internal Design

Syncit uses [rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb) under the hood to record mutations in the browser, implement screen sharing and remote control over it.

Please refer to the [design doc](./docs/design.md) for further details.
