# Syncit

Syncit, whichrefers to 'sync it', is a privacy-first co-browsing tool. It provides pixel-perfect, low latency, low bandwidth screen sharing, and remote control.

**Currently, Syncit is at an early development stage. During this stage, API could be changed frequently.**

For better improvement, feature requests and bug reports are welcomed.
